            Ace - Waterfall. (Each player starts drinking at the same time as
            the person to their left. NO player can stop drinking until the
            person before them stops.)
            <br />
            Two - You. (Whoever draws this can choose anyone to take a drink.)
            <br />
            Three - Me. (The person who draws this takes a drink.)
            <br />
            Four - Floor. (The last person to touch the floor takes a drink.)
            <br />
            Five - Guys. (All the guys at the table drink.)
            <br />
            Six - Chicks. (All the girls at the table drink.)
            <br />
            Seven - Heaven. (If you draw this card, raise your hand above you
            head. Every other player must do so as well. The last person takes a
            drink.)
            <br />
            Eight - Mate. (Choose someone to be your mate. For the rest of the
            game, they drink when you drink.)
            <br />
            Nine - Rhyme. (You say a word, then the person to your right has to
            say a word that rhymes. This continues until someone can't think of
            a word. That person takes a drink. You can't reuse words.)
            <br />
            Ten - Categories. (Come up with a category of things. The person to
            your right must name something that falls within the category. This
            continues until someone can't think of something. That person takes
            a drink.)
            <br />
            Jack - Never Have I Ever. (Everyone plays Never Have I Ever.)
            <br />
            Queen - Questions. (Ask someone a question. That person then asks
            someone else a question. This continues until someone messes up or
            fails to ask a question. That person drinks. No question can be
            repeated.)
            <br />
            King - King's Cup. (Set a rule to be followed, e.g. stand on one
            foot when you drink, only speak in an accent, etc.)
            <br />
            When each of the first 3 Kings is drawn, the person who drew it puts
            some of their drink into the King's Cup in the center of the table.
            When the 4th King is drawn, the person who drew it must drink the
            entire King's Cup.)

            Equipment
            <br/>
            The most common cups used are 18-US-fluid-ounce disposable plastic cup with ridge-lines which can
            <br/>
            be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. On each side of the table,
            <br/>
            teams assemble equilateral triangles with a convergence point focusing on the other team.
            <br/>
            Games typically use ten cups. Each team usually also has a separate cup of water used to rinse off the ball.

            Teams
            <br/>
            Beer pong is usually played with two teams of two to four players each.
            <br/>
            Each team begins the game by standing at either end of the table behind their rack of cups.

            Playing field
            <br/>
            Although the game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table, 
            <br/>
            enthusiasts may create a personalized table for use by friends and visitors.
            <br/> 
            In general, this will be a plywood board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school,
            <br/> 
            or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating. Some companies sell tables,
            <br/>
            including portable and inflatable tables.However, the game can be played on any flat surface.

          Alcohol
            <br/>
            An inexpensive pale lager or light beer of 3.2â€“5% ABV is sometimes preferred because of the large quantities 
            <br/>
            consumed during the course of several games. Sometimes under house rules, 
            <br/>
            there might be cups of other liquors used during the game. For non-drinkers, the game may be played without beer, 
            <br/>
            as is done at Utah State University, where alcohol is not allowed on campus; root beer is used instead.
            <br/>
            For sanitary reasons, the game may also be played with cups of water that players do not drink from, 
            <br/>
            instead drinking from a separate cup of beer or alcohol.
